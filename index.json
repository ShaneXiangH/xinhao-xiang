My Undergraduate Thesis: “Collaborative Multitarget Searching of Robotic Swarms Based on PF and BSO Algorithm”    Assisted to propose an exploration enhanced Robotic Particle Swarm Optimization (E2RPSO) method for multi-target searching problems on robotic swarms;\n The proposed method modifies the third item in the RPSO as an additional attraction term, not only enables the robot to avoid collisions but also guides the swarm to search unexplored regions as much as possible. This operation increases the swarm’s task-specific (top-down) diversity, making the system cover a broader search area and avoid falling into local optimums.

Assisted to propose a BSO-based collaborative searching framework for swarm robotics called Robotic BSO;\n The simulation results show that the proposed method can simulate the BSO’s guided search characteristics and has an excellent prospect for multi-target searching problems for swarm robotics.
