abstract: In swarm robotic system, collaborative multitarget searching aims to find all targets in a map as soon as possible. It is a popular researching field to design efficient collaborative multitarget searching strategies, due to their features of scalability, flexibility, robustness, as well as potential applications. Previous collaborative searching strategies exist some problem such as premature coverage, cannot well suiting large map, unknown dynamics links among robots. This research purposed a novel collaborative multitarget searching strategy named PFBSO. It uses a modified version of BSO as the cooperative searching strategy, and use PF as the path planning and obstacle avoidance strategy. The PFBSO shows great self-organization and collaborative searching ability under the robot setting with global communication and local perception ability. By the simulated performance comparing experiment, the efficacy and efficiency of PFBSO strategy has been logically proved. And after the entity experiment, it shows that PFBSO strategy has potential application value in reality.
