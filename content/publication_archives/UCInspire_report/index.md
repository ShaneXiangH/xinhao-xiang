abstract: Abstractâ€”Using Autonomous vehicles is one of the development directions in future society. One topic autonomous vehicle research should take great care of is security. Accidents should be wholly avoided from happening on autonomous vehicles. To achieve this goal, an autonomous vehicle is supposed to be equipped with a reliable anomaly detection mechanism. In general, to do anomaly detection, an autonomous vehicle needs some sensors to listen and collect real-time sensor data. Besides, it needs one or some efficient algorithms to detect the abnormal situation. In this project, the Carla simulator is used to do the real-time vehicle driving simulation, listening and collecting data from different kinds of sensors, and using outlier detection algorithms to detect the abnormal situation.
