abstract: Good 3D object detection performance from LiDAR-Camera sensors demands seamless feature alignment and fusion strategies. We propose the 3DifFusionDet framework in this paper, which structures 3D object detection as a denoising diffusion process from noisy 3D boxes to target boxes. In this framework, ground truth boxes diffuse in a random distribution for training, and the model learns to reverse the noising process. During inference, the model gradually refines a set of boxes that were generated at random to the outcomes. Under the feature align strategy, the progressive refinement method could make a significant contribution to robust LiDAR-Camera fusion. The iterative refinement process could also demonstrate great adaptability by applying the framework to various detecting circumstances where varying levels of accuracy and speed are required. Extensive experiments on KITTI, a benchmark for real-world traffic object identification, revealed that 3DifFusionDet is able to perform favorably in comparison to earlier, well-respected detectors.
