summary: "This paper proposes a BSO-based collaborative searching framework for swarm robotics called Robotic BSO."

publication: Advances in Swarm Intelligence
abstract: Swarm intelligence optimization algorithms can be adopted in swarm
  robotics for target searching tasks in a 2-D or 3-D space by treating the
  target signal strength as fitness values. Many current works in the literature
  have achieved good performance in single-target search problems. However, when
  there are multiple targets in an environment to be searched, many swarm
  intelligence-based methods may converge to specific locations prematurely,
  making it impossible to explore the environment further. The Brain Storm
  Optimization (BSO) algorithm imitates a group of humans in solving problems
  collectively. A series of guided searches can finally obtain a relatively
  optimal solution for particular optimization problems. Furthermore, with a
  suitable clustering operation, it has better multi-modal optimization
  performance, i.e., it can find multiple optima in the objective space. By
  matching the members in a robotic swarm to the individuals in the algorithm
  under both environments and robots constraints, this paper proposes a
  BSO-based collaborative searching framework for swarm robotics called Robotic
  BSO. The simulation results show that the proposed method can simulate the
  BSOâ€™s guided search characteristics and has an excellent prospect for
  multi-target searching problems for swarm robotics.
